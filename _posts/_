Product Management &amp; Development
“Product management is about insights and judgment, both of which require a sharp mind. Hard work is also necessary, but for this job, it is not sufficient.”


Marty Cagan has plenty of quotes, this one’s probably our favourite though. It kind of sums up the person we need to hire for our new Snr Product Manager role. 


It’s a newly created role with a clear focus on bringing new and adjacent products to market – both for our current customer base and to further expand our acquisition of new customers. It’s a Senior role with a global focus. 


We think this is a unique role and something suited to someone who is entrepreneurial with a strong customer focus and commercial nous. They’ll have a track record of bringing new products to market, and probably a playbook on their approach from ideation and discovery, to validation, commercialisation, go-to-market and driving adoption. They’ll most likely have a willingness to be the person driving those first deals, then gathering and sharing feedback and insights to prove the commerciality and product-market fit through to ultimately evangelising the opportunity across the global team. Our ideal candidate is most likely someone who loves a challenge, loves talking to customers and prospects, are goal and metric-driven and is a continuous learner – with a strong track record and experience that the rest of the teams can all learn from.


As our new Snr Product Manager you can expect to; 


Discover, evaluate and validate adjacent product/market opportunities and meaningful problems to solve within our customer base and across the SME landscape, in line with our company strategy and product vision. 
Work very closely with the product, UX and commercial team to seamlessly embed your products into our core and ecosystems product experience, and further expanding our commercial offering and ACV.
Work closely across functions (particularly Marketing and sales) on go-to-market and launch plans to execute on discovered product/market opportunities. 
Build a product team around you to execute on product/market opportunities and to work with engineering on the delivery of those new products. 
Develop, agree, track, forecast and drive product and growth metrics with a test-and-learn mindset.
Drive early adoption as the ‘product founder’ with founder-led sales then evangelise the product and opportunity across the sales and marketing team to scale
Complete ongoing market and competitive analysis to determine how to evolve our offering and positioning in the market to ‘win, keep and grow’ SME businesses, in your product portfolio, across the globe


You don’t need to have all the ideas, your role is finding ideas from wherever they can be found (internal ideation, customer insights and conversations, data analysis) and being highly effective at validating and/or invalidating them


Opportunities for roles with this level of impact and with such a broad scope are few and far between. It’s a big role, but we think you’ll be up to it if you have honed your Product management tradecraft and can show;


10+ years of product management experience focusing on digital-led experiences to grow usage/adoption in the platform
Highly commercial with market analysis, pricing and product-market fit experience
Deep understanding of go-to-market strategies, sales motions and digital marketing
Proven results bringing new products to market (successes, failures and very clear learnings)
Proven results running marketing programs centred around Small Business vertical plays
Experience working in global and multi-function teams 
Strong presentation and communication skills, with proven ability to author impactful content
Excel at drawing insights from customer research and a strong sense of customer empathy
Excel at collaborating with and influencing multiple stakeholders across functional groups and locations to achieve the team and organization’s goals
Demonstrated ability to lead, directly and indirectly with highly engaged team members


When you come on board here, you’ll find that we are a team of committed specialists who are eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust and we see things through. We achieve together and we’re here to do our best work. 


We’re shaping up to become a global force in business messaging, so people who feel a connection with these things and like the pace of a fast-growing company will feel part of the team.


If you’ve gotten this far and you are thinking “I’d love to do that kind of work at MessageMedia”, then please apply.


If you’ve gotten this far and thought, “my friend Tracy would be great for this”, please let her know. 
Everyone gets a response.
